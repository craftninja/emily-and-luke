<p>
  Our wedding location is River Bend in Lyons, Colorado, conveniently located between Boulder and Estes Park. Both are lovely places to stay.
</p>

<p>
  Estes Park is about 30 minutes to the northwest on the edge of the stunning Rocky Mountain National Park. Estes Park is a rustic small mountain town and surrounded by public lands. Estes is also home to the Stanley Motel, which inspired the movie <i>The Shining</i>.
</p>

<p>
  Boulder is about 25 minutes south of Lyons, between Lyons and Denver. Boulder is known for delicious food, great shopping, and street performers. It is located at the foot of the Flatirons, with easy access to various hiking trails.
